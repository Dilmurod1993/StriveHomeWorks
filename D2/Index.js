/* EXERCISE 1
Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain concepts as you are speaking to a 12 years old
*/

/* NUmbers, Operators (Where you can calculate the for example 4+5), Modulo Operators, where it can represents remainder, Special nubers (NaN) - These are numbers, which is infinite or -infinite or in other form NaN(0:0), Strings(in the text form), concatenations, converting strings and nubers, null and undefined (these two mean absence of value) Booleans (true or not, 1 or 0 multuple answer) and logic operators: AND(here if one of the answer is going to be false, the result will be false), OR(if at least on would be true, then result will be true), NOT(gives conversely answer) */


/* EXERCISE 2
Describe what is a variable. Try to explain the concept as you are speaking to a 12 years old
*/

/* Program will identify the way, where it keeps an internal state. It is like a sort of container. We  can call them in programm through the command let: let myVariable = 12 */

/* EXERCISE 3
Write the code to execute a SUM between the number 12 and 20.
*/

/* console.log( 12 + 20 ) */

/* EXERCISE 4
Create a variable named x containing the number 12.
*/

/* let x = 12
console.log(x) */


/* EXERCISE 5
Create a variable named name containing the string John Doe. */

/* let name = John Doe
console.log(name) */


/* EXERCISE 6
Execute a SUBTRACTION between the number 12 and the variable x, which stores the value 12.
*/

/* let x = 12
console.log( 12 - x ) */


/* EXERCISE 7
Create two variables: name1 and name2. name1 is equal to john, name2 is equal to John.
Verify that name1 is different from name2. 
Verify then, that name1 and name2 are equals if both lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
*/

/* let name1 = john
let name2 = John

/* EXERCISE 8
Create a variable named x (its value must be less than 10). Write the code to print the literal value of x (ex.: if x is 1 print "one", if 5 print "five" etc.).
*/

/*

let x = 6
if(x===6 && x<10){

/* EXERCISE 9
[Extra] Insert a value in a variable based on the resut of a ternary if (topic not covered during lesson, try to search it by yourself, tomorrow morning we'll discuss it together ;) )
*/

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE 
x=6 ? console.log("six") : console.log("Condition not Setisfied")
